# API Optimization and Toast Notifications

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Duplication Problem
**Problem**: APIs were being fetched multiple times due to:
- Multiple hook instances in different components
- Unnecessary re-fetching after CRUD operations
- Missing dependency management in useEffect

**Solution**: 
- Added request deduplication using `useRef` to track last fetch parameters
- Implemented optimistic updates instead of re-fetching after CRUD operations
- Used `useCallback` for stable function references
- Added proper dependency arrays to useEffect hooks

### 2. Missing Toast Notifications
**Problem**: Users had no feedback for CRUD operations (success/failure)

**Solution**:
- Installed `react-hot-toast` library
- Created `ToastContext` with success, error, info, and warning methods
- Integrated toast notifications into all CRUD operations
- Added toast provider to the main App component

## Changes Made

### New Files Created:
- `src/contexts/ToastContext.tsx` - Toast notification context
- `API_OPTIMIZATION.md` - This documentation

### Files Updated:
- `src/App.tsx` - Added ToastProvider wrapper
- `src/hooks/useJobs.ts` - Optimized with deduplication and toast notifications
- `src/hooks/useStudents.ts` - Optimized with deduplication and toast notifications  
- `src/hooks/useEmployers.ts` - Optimized with deduplication and toast notifications
- `src/hooks/useApplications.ts` - Optimized with deduplication and toast notifications
- `src/components/features/job-search/JobSearch.tsx` - Removed alert, now uses toast
- `src/components/dashboards/EmployerDashboard.tsx` - Removed alert

### Key Improvements:

1. **Request Deduplication**: Each hook now tracks the last fetch parameters and prevents duplicate requests
2. **Optimistic Updates**: CRUD operations immediately update the UI state instead of re-fetching
3. **Toast Notifications**: All operations now show success/error feedback
4. **Better Error Handling**: Consistent error messages with toast notifications
5. **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary API calls and improved user experience

## Usage Examples

### Toast Notifications:
```typescript
import { useToast } from '../contexts/ToastContext';

const { showSuccess, showError, showInfo, showWarning } = useToast();

// Success notification
showSuccess("Job created successfully!");

// Error notification  
showError("Failed to create job");

// Info notification
showInfo("Loading data...");

// Warning notification
showWarning("Please check your input");
```

### Optimized Hooks:
The hooks now automatically handle:
- Request deduplication
- Optimistic updates
- Toast notifications
- Better error handling

No changes needed in components - the hooks work the same way but are more efficient.

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users get immediate feedback for all operations
2. **Reduced API Calls**: Eliminates duplicate requests and unnecessary re-fetching
3. **Improved Performance**: Faster UI updates with optimistic rendering
4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error messages across the app
5. **Better Debugging**: Clear feedback helps identify issues quickly
